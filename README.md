# TOP-landing-page
At this point in The Odin Project Foundations curriculum, we create a website landing page as a project to put together what we've learned so far.  By completing a landing page at this juncture, this will test our HTML/CSS and flexbox skills, along with getting the elements placed and aligned where we want them.

El Tri is the nickname of our hometown friend group from high school.  For our 30 year old age milestone, we want to travel as a group to a destination few of us (ideally nobody) have been to.  Each of us are tasked to create a presentation with individual ideas for destinations with the intent that we all present our cases and vote on which destination(s) we want to travel to.  As a play on words, we are titling this excursion as "El Trienta".
